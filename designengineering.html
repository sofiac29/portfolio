      <h1>What is design engineering? </h1>

      <p>
       To me, design engineering is using engineering tools and techniques and applying them to human centered problems. It means I believe that design has a certain magic in thinking collectively + playfully but I need to be grounded in the technical to make my ideas happen.

        To Harvard, it means I'm taking core mechanical engineering classes while adding in a few more design + electrical engineering electives.

       <p>
        To my friends, it means that they still ask me what I'm studying every time we catch up.
